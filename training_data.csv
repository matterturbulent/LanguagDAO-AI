**Agenda**

1. Let’s buy the **constitution**
2. Team Updates

**Let’s buy the constitution.**

There are 23 copies of the constitution right now, 11 copies are being held in museums and there are 2 privately owned copies and 1 copy is being auctioned in December. We have a second chance at buying it and we will create a proposal to raise funds for the auction. We will adopt a privacy technique in the auction where the opponent doesn’t have an idea how much we have and use it to their advantage.

We have the option of using:

Aztec network, which is a network that helps obscure the amount in a wallet and zero suggested we use it to keep our auction funds private.

OxAA suggests we collaborate with juice box and Aztec network. We would also create a campaign for “The Legacy of ConstitutionDAO” and Matter suggests the writers team create a bounty for an article on constitutionDAO and democracy, the article has to be fresh and contain points like:

- What is ConstitutionDAO and PeopleDAO
- What is US constitution
- The momentum caused by the ConstitutionDAO
- The core team story and the legacy they live.

We would also need to find partners to get the constitution. Matter wrote a letter for our partners to sign so we know those we’re working with. AA suggests we use Ethsign so people can sign with their wallets. Zero also suggests the use of Monero or Tornado Cash to obscure our funds in case the first option fails.

- We plan to use nfts to raise the funds, the nft would be related to People, Constitution, Nicholas Cage and Avengers.
- The estimated value of the constitution is $30-20 million. We could include the people token by accepting donations in people then swap when the auction starts.
- AA suggests a rough table discussions in different regions eg south east Asia, south east Asia, China, Africa etc we could do it next weekend.
- Hack-On: A hack-on is happening in the DAO and there would be sponsors for developers and the platform could be GitHub. The hack on will hold after the Auction at December or January.

**Team Updates**

- Incubator Team

Journey Owaa has finished working on the art , including the layers and rare pieces, it has been created,voted and it down to the best pieces.

Nifo’s Perpex is done with the alpha and ready to test, we are on the lookout for testers

Soulbound just finished a new version for the soulbound token smart contract

Afro Piece is contemplating the use of Mid Journey Ai for their nft collection

Matter encouraged all projects to submit proposals as the incubator team is open to accept as many projects but only the best will be picked.
","炉边谈话，2022年11月5日


议程

让我们购买宪法
团队更新

让我们购买宪法。

现在有23本宪法，11本被保存在博物馆，还有2本私人拥有，1本将在12月进行拍卖。我们有第二次机会买下它，我们将制定一个提案，为拍卖筹集资金。我们将在拍卖中采取隐私技术，让对手不知道我们有多少钱，并利用这一点为他们带来好处。

我们可以选择使用。

Aztec网络，这是一个帮助掩盖钱包中的金额的网络，零建议我们使用它来保持我们的拍卖资金的私密性。

OxAA建议我们与Juicebox和Aztec网络合作。我们还将为 ""ConstitutionalDAO的遗产 ""创建一个活动，Matter建议作家团队为一篇关于constitutionalDAO和民主的文章创建一个赏金，文章必须是新鲜的，并包含一些要点。

什么是宪法DAO和人民DAO
什么是美国宪法
宪法DAO造成的势头
核心团队的故事和他们的遗产。

我们还需要找到合作伙伴来获得宪法。马特写了一封信，让我们的合作伙伴签字，这样我们就知道我们的合作对象。AA建议我们使用Ecsign，这样人们可以用他们的钱包签名。Zero还建议使用Monero或Tornado Cash来掩盖我们的资金，以防第一个方案失败。

我们计划使用Nft来筹集资金，Nft将与人民、宪法、尼古拉斯-凯奇和复仇者联盟有关。
宪法的估计价值为3000-2000万美元。我们可以通过接受人们的捐赠，然后在拍卖开始时进行交换，将人们的代币纳入其中。
AA建议在不同地区进行粗略的表格讨论，例如东南亚，东南亚，中国，非洲等，我们可以在下周末进行。
Hack-On。 DAO中正在发生黑客行动，将为开发者提供赞助，平台可能是GitHub。黑客行动将在12月或1月的拍卖会后举行。

团队更新

孵化器团队

旅程Owaa已经完成了艺术工作，包括层和稀有的作品，它已经创建，投票和它下来的最佳作品。

Nifo的Perpex已经完成了alpha版本，可以进行测试，我们正在寻找测试人员。

Soulbound刚刚完成了soulbound代币智能合约的新版本

Afro Piece正在考虑将Mid Journey Ai用于他们的Nft系列。

马特鼓励所有项目提交提案，因为孵化器团队愿意接受尽可能多的项目，但只有最好的才会被选中。"
"Core Proposal PIP2 – Cross-chain Bridges

Author: 0xAA#2040 and Cyrus.s#2441
Proposal Synopsis: Bring $People token cross-chain.
Required Quorum: 250M $PEOPLE 
Vote Duration: 5 days

Proposal Details:
People token is currently only available on Ethereum. The expensive gas fee is too expensive on ETH mainnet, which hinders the massive adoption of people token. Community members want to bring people token to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and other popular blockchains, such as BSC and Avalanche. The purpose of the proposal is to bring people token cross-chain.
Benefits of cross-chain:
1.	Low gas-fee
2.	Users from other chains can own people token
3.	Diversified ecosystem
We contacted with major cross-chain bridges projects：
-	Multichain (previously anyswap).
-	Celer network

They are glad to collaborate with us and both are very easy to use. The cross-chain bridges support multiple chains including Optimism, Boba network, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, Fantom, MOVR, OEC, CRO, and more.
If people choose to cross chain, we will ask for partnership with Multichain (previously anyswap), Celer Network, Chainge Finance, and Wormhole Bridge.

We have 2 options to vote for:
Option 1: Let's cross-chain.
Option 2: Do not cross-chain.

For details of cross-chain bridges, please check:
Anyswap Bridge: https://docs.multichain.org/how-it-works
Celer Bridge: https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/



Chinese Version：
People","代币目前仅在以太坊上可用。 但是ETH 主网上的gas 费太贵了，这阻碍了人们去拥有People。 社区成员希望将People代币跨链到以太坊L2解决方案和其他流行的区块链，例如 BSC 和 Avalanche。 该提案的目的是使People代币跨链。
跨链的好处：
1. 低gas费
2. 其他链的用户可以拥有people token
3. 多样化的生态系统
我们联系了最流行的跨链桥项目：
-	Multichain（以前是 anyswap）
-	Celer network
他们很高兴与我们合作，两者都非常易于使用。 跨链桥支持多条链，包括：Optimism、Boba network、Arbitrum、Polygon、BSC、Fantom、Avalanche、Fantom、MOVR、OEC、CRO等。
如果人们选择跨链，我们将与 Multichain（以前的 anyswap）、Celer Network、Chainge Finance 和 Wormhole Bridge 建立合作伙伴关系。

两个投票选项
Option 1: 跨链.
Option 2: 不跨链.

"PIP4: Convert assets in PeopleDAO treasury to $PEOPLE token
Core proposal
Author: 0xAA#2040
Reviewer: MatterTurbulent#5161
Required Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE
Vote Duration: 5 days


PeopleDAO supported PandaDAO during its early stages, providing seed funding, talent, and marketing. Following a successful launch, PandaDAO sent ETH and $PANDA back to the PeopleDAO treasury. We propose converting most of the ETH into $PEOPLE token. This action will show our confidence in the $PEOPLE ecosystem and increase our capacity to reward contributors with our native token. 

PIP4 grants the multisig team of PeopleDAO the right to convert up to 80% worth of the non-SubDAO token assets, including ETH and other tokens, to $PEOPLE tokens. The swap can be performed in centralized or decentralized exchanges. The multisig team will choose the option with minimal slippage and fees. 
We will continue holding $PANDA token, deepening the shared interest between metaDAO and subDAO, and exploring yield opportunities.

"PIP13: Formalize and Fund PeopleDAO Incubator Team
Core proposal

Author: MatterTurbulent#5161
Budget Reviewer(s): прыетранкаOG#4845 and pikachu#6696
Required Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if vote doesn't reach quorum it will pass if receiving 90% approval or more). 
Vote Duration: 5 days

As far back as our first Twitter Spaces in November, different people expressed different visions for the $PEOPLE token. PeopleDAO achieved consensus to become a platform for realizing these varied ideas, rather than commit to any one direction.

This proposal calls for the official creation of an Incubator Team in PeopleDAO, to organize resources and energy towards supporting and funding projects to further our three-prong mission: advance web3 and social good, and build an ecosystem around the $PEOPLE token.

Throughout June the Incubator Team organized informally, planning and implementing our first ever PeopleDAO Incubator program, set to happen across Q3. As part of these informal activities, we ran elections for a review committee, we reviewed proposals, and we developed the policies and calendar for the Incubator Program. Making the Incubator Team official will allow it to make budget requests.

We hope PeopleDAO constituents and $PEOPLE holders are as excited about the next chapter for the Incubator Program as we are! We urge the community to approve making the Incubator Team official and approve its first budget, which will fund activities during Q3:

Total: 198,000 PEOPLE

Budget Breakdown:
Review and vote on proposals = 12,000 PEOPLE
Reserves to pay four project coordinators = 120,000 PEOPLE
Team lead salary = 15,000 PEOPLE
Discretionary spending = 45,000 PEOPLE
Notetaking = 6,000 PEOPLE

More details here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Oxl18z25Pa8pQkN25IqL21qW65icH562cpUNfNLEBA/edit?usp=sharing

Vote YES to make the Incubator Team an official Team at PeopleDAO, and to approve the budget.
Vote NO to reject making the Team official.

","最初在11月的Twitter 音訊空間上，許多人對於$People代幣有著不同的看法，PeopleDAO達成了共識，是去實現這些不同的想法，而不是只著重在一個方向。

此提案要求在PeopleDAO中正是建立一個孵化器團隊，團隊需組織可使用的資源、支持者的能量聚集以及可資助項目，以推進如下三種使命：推行web3、社會公益、並圍繞$People代幣建立生態系統

孵化器團隊在六月草創，計畫並實施了PeopleDAO第一個孵化器計畫，該計畫將會在第三季進行，因為孵化器團隊是非正式建立的，因此我們選出了審查委員會，由審查委員進行審查項目的提案、制定提案政策以及規劃進程，藉此孵化器團隊正式化，並將允許孵化器團隊正式提出預算請求。

我们希望PeopleDAO成员和$PEOPLE持有者，对於孵化器计划的下一章節一起共襄盛舉！因此我們敦促社區批准孵化器團隊正式化後的第一個預算提案，該預算將資助第三季度的活動：

總額：198,000 $PEOPLE

预算明细：
对提案进行审查和投票 = 12,000 人
支付四名项目协调员的储备金 = 120,000 人
团队负责人工资 = 15,000 人
可自由支配的預算 = 45,000 人
記錄者 = 6,000 人

投赞成票，让孵化器团队成为 PeopleDAO 的官方团队，并批准预算。
投否决票以拒绝使团队成为正式成立。

Kể từ khi trở lại Twitter Spaces đầu tiên của chúng tôi vào tháng 11, mỗi người đã bày tỏ tầm nhìn khác nhau đối với token $PEOPLE. PeopleDAO đã đạt được sự đồng thuận để trở thành một nền tảng hiện thực hóa những ý tưởng đa dạng này, thay vì cam kết theo bất kỳ hướng nào.

Đề xuất này kêu gọi việc thành lập chính thức Nhóm Ươm Tạo (Incubator Team) trong PeopleDAO, để tổ chức các nguồn lực, năng lực hướng tới việc hỗ trợ và tài trợ cho các dự án nhằm tiếp tục sứ mệnh về ba trọng tâm của chúng tôi: Phát triển web3, lợi ích xã hội, và đồng thời xây dựng một hệ sinh thái xung quanh token $PEOPLE.

Trong suốt tháng 6, Nhóm Ươm Tạo đã được tổ chức không chính thức, lập kế hoạch và triển khai Chương trình Ươm Tạo PeopleDAO (Incubator Program) đầu tiên của chúng tôi, dự kiến ​​sẽ diễn ra trong Quý 3. Là một phần của các hoạt động không chính thức này, chúng tôi đã tiến hành bầu cử cho một ủy ban đánh giá, xem xét các đề xuất, phát triển các chính sách và lên lịch trình cho Chương trình Ươm Tạo. Việc đưa Nhóm Ươm Tạo trở thành chính thức sẽ cho phép họ đưa ra các yêu cầu về ngân sách.

Chúng tôi rất hào hứng và hy vọng các thành viên của PeopleDAO, những người nắm giữ $PEOPLE cũng hào hứng với chương tiếp theo của Chương trình Ươm Tạo! Chúng tôi kêu gọi cộng đồng chấp thuận việc đưa Nhóm Ươm Tạo thành chính thức và phê duyệt ngân sách đầu tiên của nhóm, ngân sách này sẽ tài trợ cho các hoạt động trong Quý 3:
Tổng cộng: 198,000 $PEOPLE

Chi tiêu ngân sách:
Xem xét và bỏ phiếu cho các đề xuất = 12,000 $PEOPLE
Dự trữ để trả cho bốn điều phối viên dự án = 120,000 $PEOPLE
Lương trưởng nhóm = 15,000 $PEOPLE
Chi tiêu tùy ý = 45,000 $PEOPLE

Developer is an important team in PeopleDAO, and every Season we have some goals to execute. A few of the more important goals

1. Continuously update and iterate on our website to keep it up to date and active.
To this end, our key team member прыетранкаOG#4845 has been acting as an Owner of the Website, suggesting many directions for updates and optimizations. Let's look forward to the implementation and completion of these features together.

2. Incubating SubDAO has been an important mission and revenue source for PeopleDAO. We have incubated many important SubDAOs, such as PandaDAO, LanguageDAO.
The Developer Team can provide important development capabilities for SubDAOs that are still in their initial stages. Development capability is the most needed capability in the beginning stage. In order to motivate the developers to contribute continuously and give them reasonable rewards, we also allocate a significant budget for the launch of SubDAO.

3. DAO Info aggregator. In 2022 DAO governance model organizations are spurting out, and PeopleDAO is the inheritor of the DAO philosophy. we are considering aggregating important DAO information and making a website to bring together the DAO information you want.

4. We have removed the budget allocation for the Active member of Coordinape. We believe that for Developers, ""Talk is cheap, show me the code"". We encourage people to contribute more and submit code.

5. Discretionary funds only, for flexibility. (NOT ALL WILL BE USED) Other dev needs that arise that are not included in the tasks above will belong to this budget, such as devs assists for Incubation projects, data collection job, initial website creation, etc.

开发者是PeopleDAO的一个重要团队，每个赛季我们都有一些目标要执行。下个季度几个比较重要的目标

1. 不断地更新和迭代我们的网站，使其保持最新和活跃。
为此，我们的主要团队成员прыетранкаOG#4845一直扮演着网站主人的角色，提出了许多更新和优化的方向。让我们一起期待着这些功能的实施和完成。

2. 孵化SubDAO一直是PeopleDAO的一个重要任务和收入来源。我们已经孵化了许多重要的SubDAO，如PandaDAO，LanguageDAO。
开发者团队可以为仍处于初始阶段的SubDAO提供重要的开发能力。开发能力是初始阶段最需要的能力。为了激励开发者不断做出贡献并给予他们合理的奖励，我们还为SubDAO的启动分配了大量预算。

3. DAO信息聚合器。在2022年的DAO治理模式中，各种组织如雨后春笋般涌现，PeopleDAO是DAO理念的继承者。我们考虑将重要的DAO信息聚合起来，做一个网站，汇集大家想要的DAO信息。

4. 我们取消了对Coordinape活跃成员的预算分配。我们认为，对于开发者来说，""空谈误国，实干兴邦""。我们鼓励大家多做贡献，提交代码。

5. 用于自由支配的资金，以获得灵活性。(不会全部使用)其他不包括在上述任务中的开发需求将属于这个预算，例如孵化项目的开发协助，数据收集工作，初始网站创建等。

PeopleDAO has gone a long way since its founding in late 2021, following the failure of the first ConstitutionDAO team's auction. Until now, the DAO has relied on a large number of talented contributors to withstand market fluctuations, and PeopleDAO has discovered its vision and mission as a metaDAO at the hub of the People Ecosystem, offering public goods for web3 natives. We propose the formation of PeopleDAO's eighth Team, the Operations (Ops) Team, charged with improving organizational efficiency and making the DAO more effective in reaching its key performance indicators.

The new Ops Team is essentially a rebranding effort that brings various operations under a single and formalized umbrella.The new Ops Team supplants the old General Expenditure proposal's tasks and rewards. The original idea for General Expenditures was introduced in PIP15:
https://snapshot.org/#/people-dao.eth/proposal/0xbea02e91ae863df7d32a1faabfd7f3a06496abc8f350c21ecf794676a421a0c6. 

The Ops Team Season 3 duties:

1. Discord management and moderation; including bots, webhooks, and integrations.
2. Dework platform management for bounties and task delegation.
3. DAO information aggregation management on platforms such as Notion, bip.so and Sobol.
4. Weekly meeting facilitator and note taker management.
5. Multisignatory Governor, it’s election, and the treasury management
6. Identifying educational resources about DAO tools to enhance management and contributor experience, and in rare occasions self-producing these resources. Researching mechanisms and tooling geared towards DAO management and enhancing contributor experience - the prerequisite being an existing documentation is not readily available for the general public.
7. Ensuring the proper conduct and management of all contributors and their deserved reward, Core Contributor inclusive.

The Core Contributors will collectively act as leaders of the Ops Team. The Core Contributor, who is responsible for overseeing the Ops Team's operations, has no control over the Team and cannot influence its actions. They are tasked to ensure a seamless functioning for the Team's work and ensure fair play between all DAO contributors.

PIP22：正式建立和资助PeopleDAO运营团队
核心提案

PeopleDAO 自 2021年底在ConstitutionDAO团队拍卖宪法失败之后成立以来，已经走过了漫长的道路。到目前为止，PeopleDAO依靠大量有才华的贡献者抵挡住了市场波动，并且 PeopleDAO 已经确认了它要成为metaDAO的愿景和使命来为web3用户提供公共产品。我们建议成立 PeopleDAO的第八个团队，即运营 (Ops) 团队，来负责提高组织效率并帮助DAO更有效地达到其关键绩效指标。

新的Ops团队负责品牌重塑工作，并负责各种运营事务。新的 Ops 团队将取代旧的General Expenditure的任务和奖励， 出事的General Expenditure理念是在 PIP15 中引入的：
https://snapshot.org/#/people-dao.eth/proposal/0xbea02e91ae863df7d32a1faabfd7f3a06496abc8f350c21ecf794676a421a0c6。

运营团队第3季职责：

1. Discord的管理和运营，包括机器人、webhook和集成。
2. Dework的平台管理和赏金任务委派
3. Notion、bip.so、Sobol等平台上的DAO信息聚合管理
4. 每周会议的主持人和记录员管理。
5. 多签治理、选举和国库管理
6. 寻找有关 DAO工具的科普资料来帮助管理者和贡献者提升运营DAO的经验，并在极少数情况下需要自己原创一些资料。当现有资料不容易提供给公众时，研究面向 DAO管理和增强贡献者体验的机制和工具。
7. 确保所有贡献者的有正确的行为准则， 管理包括核心贡献者在内的贡献者应得的奖励。

核心贡献者将共同担任 Ops 团队的领导者。 负责监督 Ops团队运营的核心贡献者无法控制团队，也无法影响其做出的决定。他们的任务是确保运营团队工作能无缝运作，并确保所有DAO贡献者之间的公平。

Required budget for the season: 78,000 $PEOPLE

Description:  
In Season 2, the Developer team was fairly inactive as the PeopleDAO brand identity project gained momentum across all teams and activities. The PeopleDAO’s design team led this effort, and supported by Developer team’s suggestions and feedback, produced a unified visual identity for the organization. Naturally, as this DAO-wide redesign task took a significant portion of the season's duration, regular activities on the Developer team were frozen to not result in duplicate work.

In Season 3, the Developer team plans to carry over most of the goals from Season 2 and use unspent budget. You can see the previous proposal here: https://snapshot.org/#/people-dao.eth/proposal/0x06c2ecb898f280cf0aa3446ea6a536656b3d97bf2c72fea8bba2b3ec7bf9e882. As PeopleDAO's visual identity guidelines are published, the team can now focus on original goals. Furthermore, the team plans to open public bounties on the Dework platform, allowing developers to apply for individual tasks and goals.

Objectives:

1. Extend PeopleDAO’s website:
   - Add new pages about the $PEOPLE token and its live stats and charts
   - Add a collection of articles published across various platforms that the DAO uses
   - Add profile pages for individual incubated projects and subDAOs,  introducing their purpose, team and similar important information
   - Add a section with DAO’s partners, current and previous
2. Maintain PeopleDAO’s files repository:
   - Keep the GitHub files repository in sync with all published off-chain documents, such as previous accounting spreadsheets, budget proposals, marketing materials, templates and similar resources
3. Support incubated projects:
   - Dedicate discretionary funds to support the Incubator Team and its incubated projects, any desired support from the Development Team will be applied through this budget

目标：

1. 丰富 PeopleDAO 的网站:
   - 添加有关 $PEOPLE 代币及其实时统计数据和图表的新页面
   - 添加 DAO 使用的各种平台上发布的文章的集合
   - 为各个孵化项目和 subDAO 添加简介页面，并介绍它们的愿景和团队之类的重要信息

Vote Duration: 5 days

Total budget request: 215,000 $PEOPLE

In the Writer Team's season 2 activities, the level of community participation reached a record high. With the surge of great contribution ideas and article subjects to educate the public, the Writer Team presented the new competitive publishing model to prioritise quality above quantity. In the upcoming season 3 operations, we plan to enhance and improve this system. Consequently, the Team will concentrate on three primary publication categories: the original DAOTOOL101 series, the comprehensive educational web3 series, and the new $PEOPLe ecosystem series.

The original DAOTOOL101 series will continue, but will focus more on tooling that does not have a current instructional or official documentation. In the meantime, PeopleDAO should use the tools to qualify them for authoring and publication. The web3 series released in season 2 was a new educational series aimed at both web3 and web2 audiences. The objective of the web3 series was to report on the happenings in web3, break it down into non-technical language for the typical layperson to comprehend and consume, and thereby increase the accessibility of non-native web3 users and newcomers to the web3 environment. The newest introduced series is the $PEOPLE ecosystem series. This series will focus on providing content pertaining to PeopleDAO's core, including its seasonal goal, performance indicators, incubated projects, and subDAOs.

This season, the Writer Team will also be responsible for the ConstitutionDAO anniversary event being organised by PeopleDAO. ConstitutionDAO was a defining moment for web3 and the worldwide decentralised crowdfunding movement as a whole. Although the objective of buying a copy of the US Constitution document was not accomplished, the initiative's enthusiasm, coordination efforts, and significance are unmatched. For this anniversary event, the Writer Team will collaborate with the other Teams within the DAO to celebrate ConstitutionDAO's first anniversary.

As a result, the Writer Team would like to propose the following budget for its season 3 activities, from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The upper limit of the budget sits at 215,000 $PEOPLE token this season. However, the Team will operate in an efficient manner to conserve the expenses.

在编剧团队第二季的活动中，社区参与度达到历史新高。随着大量贡献理念和文章主题涌向大众，作家团队提出了新的竞争性出版模式，将质量置于数量之上。在即将到来的第3季中，我们计划加强和改进这个系统。因此，该团队将专注于三个主要出版物类别：原始的DAOTOOL101系列，全面的web3教育系列和新$PEOPLE生态系统系列。

最初的DAOTOOL101系列将继续，但将更多地关注没有当前教学或官方文档的工具。同时，PeopleDAO 应使用这些工具使其有资格进行创作和发布。第2季发布的web3系列是针对web3和web2受众的新教育系列。Web3系列的目的是报告web3中发生的事情，将其分解为非技术语言，供典型的外行人理解和使用，从而增加非本机web3用户和web3环境新手的可访问性。最新推出的系列是$PEOPLE生态系统系列。本系列将重点提供与PeopleDAO核心相关的内容，包括其季节性目标、绩效指标、孵化项目和子DAO。

本季，作家团队还将负责由人民道组织举办的宪法DAO周年纪念活动。宪法DAO是web3和整个全球分散式众筹运动的决定性时刻。虽然购买美国宪法文件副本的目的没有实现，但该倡议的热情和协调努力，和重要性是无与伦比的。对于这个周年纪念活动，作家团队将与DAO内的其他团队合作，庆祝宪法DAO成立一周年。

因此，写作团队希望为2022年10月1日至2022年12月31日的第3季活动提出以下预算。本赛季预算的上限为215000$PEOPLE代币。但是，该小组将以有效的方式运作，以节省开支。

Funding requested for Season 3: 97,250 $PEOPLE

The Incubator Team is responsible for fulfilling the PeopleDAO mission to build an ecosystem around the $PEOPLE token that also furthers social good and Web3. Last Season we began incubating four projects/subDAOs. 

We enter the new Season implementing version 2.0 of the program, and welcoming proposals from additional applicants. We have the following goals for Season 3: 

1) Support our incubatees in reaching their milestones – Our community projects and subDAOs are the primary mechanism PeopleDAO uses to give the $PEOPLE token utility and incentivize social good. The Incubator team staffs a steward for each project, to provide project management and strategic advice. We use discretionary funds to support incubatees with ad hoc designing, marketing, organizing, and other activities. 

2) Plan for v3.0 of the Incubator – We believe in continual iteration, a design process integral to software development. Each season we produce a report analyzing our performance and prescribing improvements for the next season. 

The Team intends to carry forward leftover funds from the last season (71,750 $PEOPLE) and ask for an additional 97,250 $PEOPLE. 

Breakdown of budget:
Total  = 169,000 $PEOPLE

Reviewing Incubator Applications = 8,000 $PEOPLE (4.73%)

2) 孵化器的v3.0计划 - 我们相信持续的迭代，这是软件开发不可或缺的设计过程。每一季我们都会产生一份报告，分析我们的表现，并为下一季的改进提出建议。

Vote Duration: 5 days
Required budget for the season: 94,000 $PEOPLE

The team has set the following goals for PeopleDAO Season 3: 
Report on DAO legal wrappers: One of the goals for Season 2 was to release a report on Legal Wrappers and recommend which wrapper(s) to adopt. The research is finished so that we can release the report this season.

Amend the Constitution: The Legal Team will lead an amendment process in Season 3, seeking to complete the formalization of the Accounting, Incubator, and Operations teams. We will gather public input so the amendment addresses all interests. Our Constitution should remain a source of stability with clear policies. 

OpenLaw and Kleros: The Legal Team will research how to integrate OpenLaw for contracts between PeopleDAO and our subDAOs. The Team also needs to pre-set up a neutral arbiter to resolve small claims, insurance, intellectual property, and other contractual issues for PeopleDAO and our subDAOs. We will explore using Kleros, an open-source dispute resolution protocol that uses blockchain to mediate fairly.

Implementing Complaint Mechanisms: Building on our R&D from last Season, The Legal Team will create and distribute satisfaction surveys to contributors monthly or bimonthly. These surveys will gather information on how contributors feel about the community environment; their contribution affects their well-being, and recommendations for addressing problems. The Legal and Ops Team will collate a report and support the Core Contributor in responding to any needs.

实施投诉机制。 在上一季研发的基础上，法律团队将每月或每两个月向贡献者创建和分发满意度调查。这些调查将收集有关贡献者对社区环境的感受；他们的贡献对他们的福祉的影响，以及解决问题的建议。法律和运营团队将整理一份报告，并支持核心贡献者对任何需求作出回应。

"Core Proposal
Author: Tet#7609

Dear $PEOPLE, 

November 2021 was a landmark moment in web3 history, it was the start of ConstitutionDAO who rallied people across the global in an effort to buy the a private copy of the US Constitution that was up for auction by Sotheby’s. Although the effort ended in vain as we were outbid by Ken Griffin, a second chance has emerged for web3 to take another shot at buying a second copy of the US Constitution, hosted by Sorheby’s, again.

PeopleDAO is one of the main organisers for this year’s auction fundraiser, working closely with our partners from JuiceboxDAO, the Aztec Network, and Nucleo. As one of the key organisers, we wish to spearhead the fundraising initiative by allocating $10,000 US Dollars towards the fundraiser pool in the name of the PeopleDAO Community. With this, the community will also hold a stake in the governance of the Constitution document, under the pretext that we win the auction. 

Similar to the original ConstitutionDAO fundraiser via the Juicebox Protocol, donated funds can be refunded via the fundraiser smart contract if we were to fail in the bidding for the Constitution document. Therefore, we would like to inform the members of the community that fail safes are in place and these $10,000 donated funds will not be made redundant in the event of an auction bidding failure. 

Without further ado, we would like to hear the voices of the community. Are you in support of us contributing $10,000 US Dollars to the fundraiser initiative to once again have a chance in bidding for the US Constitution hosted by Sotheby’s on 13th December 2022? Voice out your choice, vote now. 

Choice 1: Approve the fund contribution. 
Choice 2: Deny the fund contribution. 



2021 ","年 11 月是 Web3 历史上具有里程碑意义的时刻，这是 ConstitutionDAO 的开始，它在全球范围内召集人们努力购买即将由苏富比拍卖的美国宪法的私人副本。虽然我们的努力以 Ken Griffin 的出价而告终，但 Web3 仍然有机会再次尝试购买由苏富比主办的美国宪法的第二份副本。

作为主要组织者之一，我们希望以PeopleDAO社区的名义向筹款池拨出10,000美元，作为筹款倡议的先锋。有了这个，社区也将在宪法文件的治理中占有一席之地，前提是我们赢得了拍卖。

与通过 Juicebox 协议进行的原始 ConstitutionDAO 筹款活动类似，如果我们未能竞标宪法文件，捐赠的资金可以通过筹款活动的智能合约退还。因此，我们想告知社区成员，失败的安全险已就位，如果拍卖失败，这 10,000 美元的捐赠资金将不会失去。

事不宜迟，我们想听听社区的声音。您是否支持我们向筹款活动捐赠 10,000 美元，以再次有机会竞标苏富比于 2022 年 12 月 13 日举办的美国宪法拍卖？为您的选择发声，现在投票吧。

选择一：批准资金拨款。
选择二：拒绝资金拨款。"

Required budget for the season: 50,500 $PEOPLE

Description:  
In Season 3, the Developer team has actively collaborated with other teams from PeopleDAO in order to fulfil approved objectives. Namely, in cooperation with Design and Writer team, an updated and extended PeopleDAO website was developed and deployed. The website now features profile pages of individual teams and incubated projects and subDAOs. A support for integration of Mirror.xyz articles produced within the DAO is now also available. Last but not least, an informational/educational page dedicated to the $PEOPLE token, including its live stats and charts, is about to be published.

In Season 4, the Developer team would like to continue in further extending the website to provide more information both for newcoming and existing members. Extra to this, the team would like to support the effectivity of PeopleDAO’s governance by building management tools in case no other ecosystem solution is suitable for the DAO’s use case. The team would also like to keep extra funds for support of incubated projects and extra discretionary funds, which have been not spent in the last season and would be carried-over to Season 4.

Objectives:

1. Extend PeopleDAO’s website:
   - Add dedicated DAO governance and structure page, describing the leader structure, management roles and duties, and multisig
   - Add an activity module displaying ongoing activities such as Twitter Spaces, active Snapshot proposals or scheduled Discord events
   - Add implementation supporting Chinese translation of the website content
2. Maintain PeopleDAO’s files repository:
   - Keep the GitHub files repository in sync with all published off-chain documents, such as previous accounting spreadsheets, budget proposals, marketing materials, templates and similar resources

"# Final Round of the PeopleDAO Multisig Governor Election

Dear $PEOPLE,

PeopleDAO have come a long way over the past year ever since our first formal establishment of the community Treasury since 17th January 2022. As we say goodbye to the current Governor lineup who have served the DAO since the inception of the Treasury, we would like to welcome the new soon-to-be Governors lineup in this final round of Multisig Election. 

We are going to elect 9 (NINE) Multisig Governors *de novo* in this final round from our pool of 15 self-nominated candidates who have been chosen by the community in our preliminary round of voting on our community Discord server. 

The criterions are as such:

1. A multisig Governor shall be able to comprehend and use the basic functions in the Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) to sign and approve transactions.

2. A multisig Governor shall be able to dedicate reasonable amount of time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the role, these mainly include: participate in necessary meetings, verify and sign transactions based on democratic resolutions of People DAO. 

3. A multisig Governor shall exercise due diligence to safeguard his/her own key through any reasonable means. Although the multisig is designed to protect assets even in case of compromises on parts of the signers, each Governor still need to act responsibly.

4. Outside Candidates (those not originally from the PeopleDAO) who are $PEOPLE token holders are welcomed, provided they act in good faith and are able to fulfill the above mentioned requirements.

5. The service term for our multisig Governor will be determined by a community vote on Snapshot in the upcoming PeopleDAO Improvement Proposal 33 (ie. PIP33). 

6. Monthly remuneration of the multisig Governors will be determined by the Operations Team (Ops Team) of PeopleDAO in their seasonal budget proposals. The Governors will be rewarded a minimum of 1,000 $PEOPLE tokens per month, subject to increment depending on the Ops Team's budget allowance and needs.

Details on our 15 candidates can be found in the following link. Top 9 voted candidates will be our multisig Governor.

# PeopleDAO 最后一轮的多签选举

亲爱的$PEOPLE，

自 2022 年 1 月 17 日我们首次正式成立社区财政部以来，PeopleDAO 在过去的一年里取得了长足的进步。当我们告别自财政部成立以来一直为 DAO 服务的现任总督阵容时，我们想欢迎新的即将成为最后一轮多签人选举的阵容。

在最后一轮中，我们将从我们社区 Discord 服务器上的初步投票中选出的 15 名自荐候选人中选出 9 名多签人。

多签人标准如下：

1. 多签监管者应能够理解和使用 Safe（以前称为 Gnosis Safe）中的基本功能来签署和批准交易。

2. 多签监管者应能够投入合理的时间来履行角色的职责和责任，这些主要包括：参加必要的会议，根据 PeopleDAO 的民主决议验证和签署交易。

3. 多签监管者应尽职尽责地通过任何合理的方式保护他/她自己的密钥。 尽管多签名旨在保护资产，即使在部分签名者妥协的情况下，每个多签人仍然需要负责任地行事。

4. 欢迎持有 $PEOPLE 代币的外部候选人（并非最初来自 PeopleDAO 的候选人），前提是他们诚信行事并能够满足上述要求。

5. 我们多签人的服务期限将由社区在即将到来的 PeopleDAO 改进提案 33（ PIP33）中对 Snapshot 进行投票来确定。

6. 多签理事的月薪将由 PeopleDAO 的运营团队（Ops Team）在其季节性预算提案中确定。 多签人每月将获得至少 1,000个 ¥PEOPLE 代币奖励，具体奖励金额取决于 Ops 团队的预算津贴和需求。

有关我们 15 名候选人的详细信息，请访问以下链接。 前 9 名投票的候选人将是我们的多签人。
