A multisig Governor shall be able to comprehend and use the basic functions in the Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) to sign and approve transactions.\\n\\n2. A multisig Governor shall be able to dedicate reasonable amount of time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the role, these mainly include: participate in necessary meetings, verify and sign transactions based on democratic resolutions of People DAO. \\n\\n3. A multisig Governor shall exercise due diligence to safeguard his/her own key through any reasonable means. Although the multisig is designed to protect assets even in case of compromises on parts of the signers, each Governor still need to act responsibly.\\n\\n4. Outside Candidates (those not originally from the PeopleDAO) who are $PEOPLE token holders are welcomed, provided they act in good faith and are able to fulfill the above mentioned requirements.\\n\\n5. The service term for our multisig Governor will be determined by a community vote on Snapshot in the upcoming PeopleDAO Improvement Proposal 33 (ie. PIP33). \\n\\n6. Monthly remuneration of the multisig Governors will be determined by the Operations Team (Ops Team) of PeopleDAO in their seasonal budget proposals.

Although the effort ended in vain as we were outbid by Ken Griffin, a second chance has emerged for web3 to take another shot at buying a second copy of the US Constitution, hosted by Sorheby’s, again.\\n\\nPeopleDAO is one of the main organisers for this year’s auction fundraiser, working closely with our partners from JuiceboxDAO, the Aztec Network, and Nucleo. As one of the key organisers, we wish to spearhead the fundraising initiative by allocating $10,000 US Dollars towards the fundraiser pool in the name of the PeopleDAO Community. With this, the community will also hold a stake in the governance of the Constitution document, under the pretext that we win the auction. \\n\\nSimilar to the original ConstitutionDAO fundraiser via the Juicebox Protocol, donated funds can be refunded via the fundraiser smart contract if we were to fail in the bidding for the Constitution document. Therefore, we would like to inform the members of the community that fail safes are in place and these $10,000 donated funds will not be made redundant in the event of an auction bidding failure. \\n\\nWithout further ado, we would like to hear the voices of the community. Are you in support of us contributing $10,000 US Dollars to the fundraiser initiative to once again have a chance in bidding for the US Constitution hosted by Sotheby’s on 13th December 2022? Voice out your choice, vote now. \\n\\nChoice 1: Approve the fund contribution. \\nChoice 2: Deny the fund contribution. \\n\\n\\n\\n2021 年 11 月是 Web3 历史上具有里程碑意义的时刻，这是 ConstitutionDAO 的开始，它在全球范围内召集人们努力购买即将由苏富比拍卖的美国宪法的私人副本。虽然我们的努力以 Ken Griffin 的出价而告终，但 Web3 仍然有机会再次尝试购买由苏富比主办的美国宪法的第二份副本。\\n\\n作为主要组织者之一，我们希望以PeopleDAO社区的名义向筹款池拨出10,000美元，作为筹款倡议的先锋。有了这个，社区也将在宪法文件的治理中占有一席之地，前提是我们赢得了拍卖。\\n\\n与通过 Juicebox 协议进行的原始 ConstitutionDAO 筹款活动类似，如果我们未能竞标宪法文件，捐赠的资金可以通过筹款活动的智能合约退还。因此，我们想告知社区成员，失败的安全险已就位，如果拍卖失败，这 10,000 美元的捐赠资金将不会失去。\\n\\n事不宜迟，我们想听听社区的声音。您是否支持我们向筹款活动捐赠 10,000 美元，以再次有机会竞标苏富比于 2022 年 12 月 13 日举办的美国宪法拍卖？为您的选择发声，现在投票吧。\\n\\n选择一：批准资金拨款。\\n选择二：拒绝资金拨款。\"\n",

With the surge of great contribution ideas and article subjects to educate the public, the Writer Team presented the new competitive publishing model to prioritise quality above quantity.

Consequently, the Team will concentrate on three primary publication categories: the original DAOTOOL101 series, the comprehensive educational web3 series, and the new $PEOPLe ecosystem series.\\n\\nThe original DAOTOOL101 series will continue, but will focus more on tooling that does not have a current instructional or official documentation. In the meantime, PeopleDAO should use the tools to qualify them for authoring and publication. The web3 series released in season 2 was a new educational series aimed at both web3 and web2 audiences. The objective of the web3 series was to report on the happenings in web3, break it down into non-technical language for the typical layperson to comprehend and consume, and thereby increase the accessibility of non-native web3 users and newcomers to the web3 environment. The newest introduced series is the $PEOPLE ecosystem series. This series will focus on providing content pertaining to PeopleDAO's core, including its seasonal goal, performance indicators, incubated projects, and subDAOs.\\n\\nThis season, the Writer Team will also be responsible for the ConstitutionDAO anniversary event being organised by PeopleDAO. ConstitutionDAO was a defining moment for web3 and the worldwide decentralised crowdfunding movement as a whole.

The upper limit of the budget sits at 215,000 $PEOPLE token this season.

Having previously focused on developing uniform DAO iconography via social media design and website rebranding, as well as the creation of contributor POAPs, it has now achieved its aim of designing various areas of PeopleDAO that need a branded design identity.\\n\\nDuring Season 2, the Design Team focused on branding by producing and assembling the Brand Book, creating social media design templates for use by the DAO, and redesigning our website with the assistance of our Dev team. It was also responsible for POAP affairs, including the creation of POAP events, the maintenance of a positive connection with the official POAP team, and, most importantly, offering incentives and acknowledging the significant efforts of DAO members. The Design Team is expanding its horizons for Season 3 with the addition of new members and PeopleDAO anniversary design efforts.\\n\\nFor Season 3, the PeopleDAO Design Team will continue working on the website by adding new designs through the use of elements that were previously made in Season 2. Some of the new website pages envisioned to be accomplished include the (i) publishing module - lists all publications (e.g., articles, blog posts, etc.) produced by the DAO from sources like Mirror, Notion, and other platforms; (ii) project profiles - describes the purpose and mission of each incubation project, and provides information about each project’s team members, external links, and more; and (iii) token profile - display the history, properties, and statistics about the $PEOPLE token. Additionally, the crafting of infographics and other content-rich publicity and promotional materials will also be continued for.\\n\\nRegarding new jobs, the POAP Lead role has been promoted to Co-Lead; this role will include overseeing additional shared design activities with the Design Team Lead. This requires participation in Fireside chat sessions, POAP-related activities, and collaboration with the POAP Assistant. In addition, we are raising the Season 2 POAP Monitor post to the far more aggressive POAP Assistant position. They will work closely with the Co-Lead to manage POAP operations, including monitoring people who qualify for our new POAP award system and attending Fireside chat if none of the Leads are available.\\n\\nDue to the approaching PeopleDAO Anniversary, the Design Team has additionally allocated an expected budget breakdown for the event's design and promotional materials. This includes social media postings, POAPs, and additional money for discretionary distribution and monitoring. PeopleDAO Anniversary and general Design Team discretionary funding will only be granted for unanticipated but essential DAO design requirements.\\n\\n\\nWith these, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 3.\\nThank you, and Long Live PeopleDAO!\\n\\nMore detailed budget here: Design Team Budget - Season 3 \\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A6di0vfETLtoshX_ee5RbwRg1j4SvAEi9fyUUdQwo4w/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\n![Screen Shot 2022-10-22 at 4.15.30 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreicmocrz7gxszrlvk3e6iltnroqrxme2q35cmoavp52thwgb5ezsbe)\\n    \"\n",

As PeopleDAO's visual identity guidelines are published, the team can now focus on original goals. Furthermore, the team plans to open public bounties on the Dework platform, allowing developers to apply for individual tasks and goals.\\n\\nObjectives:\\n\\n1. Extend PeopleDAO’s website:\\n   - Add new pages about the $PEOPLE token and its live stats and charts\\n   - Add a collection of articles published across various platforms that the DAO uses\\n   - Add profile pages for individual incubated projects and subDAOs,  introducing their purpose, team and similar important information\\n   - Add a section with DAO’s partners, current and previous\\n2.

People in the whitelist spot are able to mint one NFT for half the sale price. Furthermore, we will also allocate about 10 free-minted NFTs for PeopleDAO core contributors and 20 NFTs for giveaway campaigns for the project marketing. The remaining 1,199 NFTs will be put on market sales. These incentives would encourage people to learn and hold $PEOPLE tokens if they want to purchase NFTs at a discount.

In order to motivate the developers to contribute continuously and give them reasonable rewards, we also allocate a significant budget for the launch of SubDAO.\\n\\n3. DAO Info aggregator. In 2022 DAO governance model organizations are spurting out, and PeopleDAO is the inheritor of the DAO philosophy. we are considering aggregating important DAO information and making a website to bring together the DAO information you want.\\n\\n4. We have removed the budget allocation for the Active member of Coordinape. We believe that for Developers, \\\"Talk is cheap, show me the code\\\".

Additionally, the Design Team will also continue to reinforce positive and meaningful contributions through its POAP efforts, as it works on a new system of rewarding, and a need for a POAP Monitor.

This project is under the lead of Niffo, a forex and crypto trader, and developer. The project believes that blockchain technology can increase access to financial instruments, unlocking new economic opportunities for worldwide participants. The mission of PEDEX, and Perpetual DAO, is to open up a DeFi platform to everyone that facilitates the trading of perpetual futures. The key advantage of said platform will be its superior UX/UI design, as well as providing functionalities that many DeFi protocols lack in today’s markets. A brief feature description can be found below: \\n\\n- Placing bulk Limit orders through clicking on the order book \\n- Pre-defined Take Profit, Stop Loss with Limit and Market orders \\n- Multi-updating of Take Profit and Stop Loss orders \\n- Trading directly from the order book \\n- Adding widgets on the home screen and free moving \\n- Managing multiple trade accounts by easy switching \\n\\nPerpetual DAO would like to request a funding amount of $7,500 USD in total to help its development. The PEDEX platform will utilize the bulk of the funding of $7,500 USD, in its blockchain-integrated development operation for a functioning demo dApp and website in Q3 2022. The cold start funding will help the PEDEX team to further the development of the platform and hire new blood focused on blockchain-integration tasks, as well as frontend development. The detailed breakdown are as follows:\\n\\n![Screenshot 2022-06-23 at 12.43.25 AM.png](ipfs://QmRYA7RSuKiPiCjjFbUouNFDgEAkGsUX5yABvJwDEW9qsx)\\n\\nPost-development in Q4 2022, the PEDEX platform and its governing subDAO, Perpetual DAO, will organize a seed round to accumulate additional funding when a functional dApp is produced. Said seed round funding will be conducted on Juicebox - where 5% of the funding $ETH and Perpetual DAO’s governance token will be delegated to the People DAO Treasury. In addition to this, Perpetual DAO will also set up a donation platform known as The Foundation, where all donation proceeds will be given to the People DAO Treasury to help incubate future projects. The donation for this foundation will come from 1% of all transaction fees revenue on the PEDEX platform, as well as altruistic donors from around the world. Lastly, a separate portion of the trading fees, valued at 1%, will be provided to People DAO in support of its development. \\n\\nThe distinction between these two streams of constant funding (i.e. from the Foundation, and from the trading fees) is to differentiate the charitable narrative, and the profit narrative. Donation from the Foundation is solely for incubation purpose, whereas returns derived from the trading fees is a return on investment for People DAO. The latter can be used for any financial purpose by the People DAO community, incubation inclusive.\\n\\nThe detailed proposal can be found here, together with a Chinese version: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZs6CYrqET9Yg85illyQqo11GjWuyzOoDr7lCAY5oP4/edit?usp=sharing \\n\\nVoting choice:\\nChoice 1: Yes, fund Perpetual DAO & PEDEX.\\nChoice2: No, do not fund Perpetual DAO & PEDEX.\\n\"\n",

We ask the PeopleDAO community to approve coldstart funding worth approximately $7700 USD to launch the project titled The Lost Children of Benin City. \\n\\nColdstart funding will support Existential Zoomer traveling to Benin City, conducting interviews and background research for the project, as well as producing some visual assets in the form of photographic and video content. As a deliverable, Zoomer will produce a multimedia article showcasing her research and building support for additional fundraising. The visual assets can inspire creative development of the NFT collection. \\n\\nIn terms of financial sustainability, the forthcoming NFT collection and video streaming fees will both act as forms of revenue. We plan to explore multiple funding sources to fund the broader docu-series, including Gitcoin, CultDAO, and PeopleDAO.   \\n\\nThis project would count as one of the first docu-series launched and financed by a DAO and web3 mechanisms. Using an NFT collection both as a fundraiser and a vehicle for philanthropy makes the effort even more innovative. \\n\\nHere is a message from Existential Zoomer about what the initiative means to her: “This project is dedicated to all the ones we’ve lost, the ones who will never be found and the untold stories, and to the ones we have found but who are scarred and will never be whole again.”  \\n\\nSnapshot Voting: \\nVote YES to fund the coldstart of $7,700 USD and vote NO to reject the coldstart proposal.\\n\\nRead the whitepaper for more information about The Lost Children of Benin City: https://peopledao.mirror.xyz/EkTz2hKW8mIAIVgCZfc3mkJNJlvt68KbVye-QsWgQgQ \"\n",
