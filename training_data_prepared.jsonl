We have a second chance at buying it and we will create a proposal to raise funds for the auction. We will adopt a privacy technique in the auction where the opponent doesn’t have an idea how much we have and use it to their advantage.\n\nWe have the option of using:\n\nAztec network, which is a network that helps obscure the amount in a wallet and zero suggested we use it to keep our auction funds private.\n\nOxAA suggests we collaborate with juice box and Aztec network. We would also create a campaign for “The Legacy of ConstitutionDAO” and Matter suggests the writers team create a bounty for an article on constitutionDAO and democracy, the article has to be fresh and contain points like:\n\n- What is ConstitutionDAO and PeopleDAO\n- What is US constitution\n- The momentum caused by the ConstitutionDAO\n- The core team story and the legacy they live.\n\nWe would also need to find partners to get the constitution. Matter wrote a letter for our partners to sign so we know those we’re working with. AA suggests we use Ethsign so people can sign with their wallets. Zero also suggests the use of Monero or Tornado Cash to obscure our funds in case the first option fails.\n\n- We plan to use nfts to raise the funds, the nft would be related to People, Constitution, Nicholas Cage and Avengers.\n- The estimated value of the constitution is $30-20 million. We could include the people token by accepting donations in people then swap when the auction starts.\n- AA suggests a rough table discussions in different regions eg south east Asia, south east Asia, China, Africa etc we could do it next weekend.\n- Hack-On: A hack-on is happening in the DAO and there would be sponsors for developers and the platform could be GitHub. The hack on will hold after the Auction at December or January.\n\n**Team Updates**\n\n- Incubator Team\n\nJourney Owaa has finished working on the art , including the layers and rare pieces, it has been created,voted and it down to the best pieces.\n\nNifo’s Perpex is done with the alpha and ready to test, we are on the lookout for testers\n\nSoulbound just finished a new version for the soulbound token smart contract\n\nAfro Piece is contemplating the use of Mid Journey Ai for their nft collection\n\nMatter encouraged all projects to submit proposals as the incubator team is open to accept as many projects but only the best will be picked.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 炉边谈话，2022年11月5日\n\n\n议程\n\n让我们购买宪法\n团队更新\n\n让我们购买宪法。\n\n现在有23本宪法，11本被保存在博物馆，还有2本私人拥有，1本将在12月进行拍卖。我们有第二次机会买下它，我们将制定一个提案，为拍卖筹集资金。我们将在拍卖中采取隐私技术，让对手不知道我们有多少钱，并利用这一点为他们带来好处。\n\n我们可以选择使用。\n\nAztec网络，这是一个帮助掩盖钱包中的金额的网络，零建议我们使用它来保持我们的拍卖资金的私密性。\n\nOxAA建议我们与Juicebox和Aztec网络合作。我们还将为 \"ConstitutionalDAO的遗产 \"创建一个活动，Matter建议作家团队为一篇关于constitutionalDAO和民主的文章创建一个赏金，文章必须是新鲜的，并包含一些要点。\n\n什么是宪法DAO和人民DAO\n什么是美国宪法\n宪法DAO造成的势头\n核心团队的故事和他们的遗产。\n\n我们还需要找到合作伙伴来获得宪法。马特写了一封信，让我们的合作伙伴签字，这样我们就知道我们的合作对象。AA建议我们使用Ecsign，这样人们可以用他们的钱包签名。Zero还建议使用Monero或Tornado Cash来掩盖我们的资金，以防第一个方案失败。\n\n我们计划使用Nft来筹集资金，Nft将与人民、宪法、尼古拉斯-凯奇和复仇者联盟有关。\n宪法的估计价值为3000-2000万美元。我们可以通过接受人们的捐赠，然后在拍卖开始时进行交换，将人们的代币纳入其中。\nAA建议在不同地区进行粗略的表格讨论，例如东南亚，东南亚，中国，非洲等，我们可以在下周末进行。\nHack-On。 DAO中正在发生黑客行动，将为开发者提供赞助，平台可能是GitHub。黑客行动将在12月或1月的拍卖会后举行。\n\n团队更新\n\n孵化器团队\n\n旅程Owaa已经完成了艺术工作，包括层和稀有的作品，它已经创建，投票和它下来的最佳作品。\n\nNifo的Perpex已经完成了alpha版本，可以进行测试，我们正在寻找测试人员。\n\nSoulbound刚刚完成了soulbound代币智能合约的新版本\n\nAfro Piece正在考虑将Mid Journey Ai用于他们的Nft系列。\n\n马特鼓励所有项目提交提案，因为孵化器团队愿意接受尽可能多的项目，但只有最好的才会被选中。 END"}

Until now, the DAO has relied on a large number of talented contributors to withstand market fluctuations, and PeopleDAO has discovered its vision and mission as a metaDAO at the hub of the People Ecosystem, offering public goods for web3 natives. We propose the formation of PeopleDAO's eighth Team, the Operations (Ops) Team, charged with improving organizational efficiency and making the DAO more effective in reaching its key performance indicators.\n\nThe new Ops Team is essentially a rebranding effort that brings various operations under a single and formalized umbrella.The new Ops Team supplants the old General Expenditure proposal's tasks and rewards. The original idea for General Expenditures was introduced in PIP15:\nhttps:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/people-dao.eth\/proposal\/0xbea02e91ae863df7d32a1faabfd7f3a06496abc8f350c21ecf794676a421a0c6. \n\nThe Ops Team Season 3 duties:\n\n1. Discord management and moderation; including bots, webhooks, and integrations.\n2. Dework platform management for bounties and task delegation.\n3. DAO information aggregation management on platforms such as Notion, bip.so and Sobol.\n4. Weekly meeting facilitator and note taker management.\n5. Multisignatory Governor, it’s election, and the treasury management\n6. Identifying educational resources about DAO tools to enhance management and contributor experience, and in rare occasions self-producing these resources. Researching mechanisms and tooling geared towards DAO management and enhancing contributor experience - the prerequisite being an existing documentation is not readily available for the general public.\n7. Ensuring the proper conduct and management of all contributors and their deserved reward, Core Contributor inclusive.\n\nThe Core Contributors will collectively act as leaders of the Ops Team. The Core Contributor, who is responsible for overseeing the Ops Team's operations, has no control over the Team and cannot influence its actions. They are tasked to ensure a seamless functioning for the Team's work and ensure fair play between all DAO contributors.\n\nSeason 3 Budget Proposal (Oct 1 to Dec 31)\n \n![Screenshot 2022-10-13 at 9.50.42 AM.png](ipfs:\/\/bafkreia5s2x46kzgrwx4vdrvicrkm5bm34y2evqslf3a7iasswyylmxcam)\n    \n\nDetailed budget breakdown: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1VcSLX8arqvpOEP2G9UVkOnO_x7ShDxt4Mt2Bi3tdofc\/edit?usp=sharing \n\n---\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 中文翻译:\n\n一个组织只有通过卓越运营才能抓住非凡的机会。\n\nPIP22：正式建立和资助PeopleDAO运营团队\n核心提案\n作者：ifun#9490 & Tet#7609\n审核者：核心团队\n法定票数：一亿$PEOPLE代币（如果不满足最低法定代币，提案将需要超过 90% 的选票才能通过）\n投票时间：5天\n\n本季度所需预算：1,013,000个$PEOPLE代币\n\nPeopleDAO 自 2021年底在ConstitutionDAO团队拍卖宪法失败之后成立以来，已经走过了漫长的道路。到目前为止，PeopleDAO依靠大量有才华的贡献者抵挡住了市场波动，并且 PeopleDAO 已经确认了它要成为metaDAO的愿景和使命来为web3用户提供公共产品。我们建议成立 PeopleDAO的第八个团队，即运营 (Ops) 团队，来负责提高组织效率并帮助DAO更有效地达到其关键绩效指标。\n\n新的Ops团队负责品牌重塑工作，并负责各种运营事务。新的 Ops 团队将取代旧的General Expenditure的任务和奖励， 出事的General Expenditure理念是在 PIP15 中引入的：\nhttps:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/people-dao.eth\/proposal\/0xbea02e91ae863df7d32a1faabfd7f3a06496abc8f350c21ecf794676a421a0c6。\n\n运营团队第3季职责：\n\n1.

The PeopleDAO’s design team led this effort, and supported by Developer team’s suggestions and feedback, produced a unified visual identity for the organization. Naturally, as this DAO-wide redesign task took a significant portion of the season's duration, regular activities on the Developer team were frozen to not result in duplicate work.\n\nIn Season 3, the Developer team plans to carry over most of the goals from Season 2 and use unspent budget.

Furthermore, the team plans to open public bounties on the Dework platform, allowing developers to apply for individual tasks and goals.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Extend PeopleDAO’s website:\n   - Add new pages about the $PEOPLE token and its live stats and charts\n   - Add a collection of articles published across various platforms that the DAO uses\n   - Add profile pages for individual incubated projects and subDAOs,  introducing their purpose, team and similar important information\n   - Add a section with DAO’s partners, current and previous\n2.

With the surge of great contribution ideas and article subjects to educate the public, the Writer Team presented the new competitive publishing model to prioritise quality above quantity. In the upcoming season 3 operations, we plan to enhance and improve this system. Consequently, the Team will concentrate on three primary publication categories: the original DAOTOOL101 series, the comprehensive educational web3 series, and the new $PEOPLe ecosystem series.\n\nThe original DAOTOOL101 series will continue, but will focus more on tooling that does not have a current instructional or official documentation. In the meantime, PeopleDAO should use the tools to qualify them for authoring and publication. The web3 series released in season 2 was a new educational series aimed at both web3 and web2 audiences. The objective of the web3 series was to report on the happenings in web3, break it down into non-technical language for the typical layperson to comprehend and consume, and thereby increase the accessibility of non-native web3 users and newcomers to the web3 environment. The newest introduced series is the $PEOPLE ecosystem series. This series will focus on providing content pertaining to PeopleDAO's core, including its seasonal goal, performance indicators, incubated projects, and subDAOs.\n\nThis season, the Writer Team will also be responsible for the ConstitutionDAO anniversary event being organised by PeopleDAO. ConstitutionDAO was a defining moment for web3 and the worldwide decentralised crowdfunding movement as a whole. Although the objective of buying a copy of the US Constitution document was not accomplished, the initiative's enthusiasm, coordination efforts, and significance are unmatched. For this anniversary event, the Writer Team will collaborate with the other Teams within the DAO to celebrate ConstitutionDAO's first anniversary.\n\nAs a result, the Writer Team would like to propose the following budget for its season 3 activities, from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The upper limit of the budget sits at 215,000 $PEOPLE token this season. However, the Team will operate in an efficient manner to conserve the expenses.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 11.14.33 PM.png](ipfs:\/\/bafkreihqlkkpqaq2ornhnfgqxb6cvb45xwkzo426onunealnwwxgfyvqsa)\n\nVoting choices:\n- Choice 1: Approve proposal.\n- Choice 2: Deny proposal.\n\n---\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 中文翻译\n\n# PIP25:写作团队第三季预算提案\n## 核心提案\n作者： Tet#7609\n评论家：koala#4988\n所需法定人数：1亿$PEOPLE（如未超过法定人数，提案需超过90%票数方可通过）\n投票持续时间：5天\n\n总预算要求：215,000 $PEOPLE 代币\n\n在编剧团队第二季的活动中，社区参与度达到历史新高。随着大量贡献理念和文章主题涌向大众，作家团队提出了新的竞争性出版模式，将质量置于数量之上。在即将到来的第3季中，我们计划加强和改进这个系统。因此，该团队将专注于三个主要出版物类别：原始的DAOTOOL101系列，全面的web3教育系列和新$PEOPLE生态系统系列。\n\n最初的DAOTOOL101系列将继续，但将更多地关注没有当前教学或官方文档的工具。同时，PeopleDAO 应使用这些工具使其有资格进行创作和发布。第2季发布的web3系列是针对web3和web2受众的新教育系列。Web3系列的目的是报告web3中发生的事情，将其分解为非技术语言，供典型的外行人理解和使用，从而增加非本机web3用户和web3环境新手的可访问性。最新推出的系列是$PEOPLE生态系统系列。本系列将重点提供与PeopleDAO核心相关的内容，包括其季节性目标、绩效指标、孵化项目和子DAO。\n\n本季，作家团队还将负责由人民道组织举办的宪法DAO周年纪念活动。宪法DAO是web3和整个全球分散式众筹运动的决定性时刻。虽然购买美国宪法文件副本的目的没有实现，但该倡议的热情和协调努力，和重要性是无与伦比的。对于这个周年纪念活动，作家团队将与DAO内的其他团队合作，庆祝宪法DAO成立一周年。\n\n因此，写作团队希望为2022年10月1日至2022年12月31日的第3季活动提出以下预算。本赛季预算的上限为215000$PEOPLE代币。但是，该小组将以有效的方式运作，以节省开支。\n \n![Screenshot 2022-10-25 at 7.14.28 PM.png](ipfs:\/\/bafkreice6xjkhtazbdrizgdpiilcxfingd5dkv76rq3gw2oqw2jp4rdcoa)\n\n投票选择：\n- 选项 1：批准提案。\n- 选择2：拒绝提案。 END"}

As one of the key organisers, we wish to spearhead the fundraising initiative by allocating $10,000 US Dollars towards the fundraiser pool in the name of the PeopleDAO Community. With this, the community will also hold a stake in the governance of the Constitution document, under the pretext that we win the auction. \n\nSimilar to the original ConstitutionDAO fundraiser via the Juicebox Protocol, donated funds can be refunded via the fundraiser smart contract if we were to fail in the bidding for the Constitution document.

{"prompt":"# Final Round of the PeopleDAO Multisig Governor Election\n\nDear $PEOPLE,\n\nPeopleDAO have come a long way over the past year ever since our first formal establishment of the community Treasury since 17th January 2022. As we say goodbye to the current Governor lineup who have served the DAO since the inception of the Treasury, we would like to welcome the new soon-to-be Governors lineup in this final round of Multisig Election. \n\nWe are going to elect 9 (NINE) Multisig Governors *de novo* in this final round from our pool of 15 self-nominated candidates who have been chosen by the community in our preliminary round of voting on our community Discord server. \n\nThe criterions are as such:\n\n1. A multisig Governor shall be able to comprehend and use the basic functions in the Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) to sign and approve transactions.\n\n2. A multisig Governor shall be able to dedicate reasonable amount of time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the role, these mainly include: participate in necessary meetings, verify and sign transactions based on democratic resolutions of People DAO. \n\n3. A multisig Governor shall exercise due diligence to safeguard his\/her own key through any reasonable means. Although the multisig is designed to protect assets even in case of compromises on parts of the signers, each Governor still need to act responsibly.\n\n4. Outside Candidates (those not originally from the PeopleDAO) who are $PEOPLE token holders are welcomed, provided they act in good faith and are able to fulfill the above mentioned requirements.\n\n5. The service term for our multisig Governor will be determined by a community vote on Snapshot in the upcoming PeopleDAO Improvement Proposal 33 (ie. PIP33). \n\n6. Monthly remuneration of the multisig Governors will be determined by the Operations Team (Ops Team) of PeopleDAO in their seasonal budget proposals. The Governors will be rewarded a minimum of 1,000 $PEOPLE tokens per month, subject to increment depending on the Ops Team's budget allowance and needs.\n\nDetails on our 15 candidates can be found in the following link. Top 9 voted candidates will be our multisig Governor.\n\n[Candidate info and rules of the election.](https:\/\/peopledao.mirror.xyz\/p98hOHWhd1YSBoom8e7twMIxenMygIZE4qyxG0dYFTY)\n\n---\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 中文翻译\n\n# PeopleDAO 最后一轮的多签选举\n\n亲爱的$PEOPLE，\n\n自 2022 年 1 月 17 日我们首次正式成立社区财政部以来，PeopleDAO 在过去的一年里取得了长足的进步。当我们告别自财政部成立以来一直为 DAO 服务的现任总督阵容时，我们想欢迎新的即将成为最后一轮多签人选举的阵容。\n\n在最后一轮中，我们将从我们社区 Discord 服务器上的初步投票中选出的 15 名自荐候选人中选出 9 名多签人。\n\n多签人标准如下：\n\n1. 多签监管者应能够理解和使用 Safe（以前称为 Gnosis Safe）中的基本功能来签署和批准交易。\n\n2. 多签监管者应能够投入合理的时间来履行角色的职责和责任，这些主要包括：参加必要的会议，根据 PeopleDAO 的民主决议验证和签署交易。\n\n3. 多签监管者应尽职尽责地通过任何合理的方式保护他\/她自己的密钥。 尽管多签名旨在保护资产，即使在部分签名者妥协的情况下，每个多签人仍然需要负责任地行事。\n\n4. 欢迎持有 $PEOPLE 代币的外部候选人（并非最初来自 PeopleDAO 的候选人），前提是他们诚信行事并能够满足上述要求。\n\n5. 我们多签人的服务期限将由社区在即将到来的 PeopleDAO 改进提案 33（ PIP33）中对 Snapshot 进行投票来确定。\n\n6. 多签理事的月薪将由 PeopleDAO 的运营团队（Ops Team）在其季节性预算提案中确定。 多签人每月将获得至少 1,000个 ¥PEOPLE 代币奖励，具体奖励金额取决于 Ops 团队的预算津贴和需求。\n\n有关我们 15 名候选人的详细信息，请访问以下链接。 前 9 名投票的候选人将是我们的多签人。\n\n[候选人信息和选举规则。](https:\/\/peopledao.mirror.xyz\/p98hOHWhd1YSBoom8e7twMIxenMygIZE4qyxG0dYFTY) END"}
